# Project Brainiac
Brain shift is an important challenge in neurosurgery, where the brain's position and shape can deform during surgery, impacting the accuracy of pre-surgical imaging which will be consulted during the surgical procedure. Addressing this matter is crucial for improving surgical results and ensuring precision during neurosurgical procedures. Project Brainiac aims to create a simulation that simulates brain shift and validates its effectiveness through collaboration with experienced neurosurgeons.

# Objective
1. Develop a simulation for simulating brain shift based on pre-surgical brain scans.

2. Generate permutations of images of brain shifts based on pre-surgical scans.

3. Collaborate with neurosurgeons to validate the realism and accuracy of the generated images.

4. Provide insights to surgeons and improvements in neurosurgical planning, intraoperative guidance and training.

Project Brainiac aims to contribute to the advancement of neurosurgical techniques by providing a valuable tool for predicting and understanding brain shift. This project will mainly serve to be a training tool for surgeons. By providing a simulated environment that mimics real world scenarios Project Brainiac will allow surgeons to maintain and hone their skills.


# Dataset
BraTS has always been focusing on the evaluation of state-of-the-art methods for the segmentation of brain tumors in multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. BraTS 2020 utilizes multi-institutional pre-operative MRI scans and primarily focuses on the segmentation
